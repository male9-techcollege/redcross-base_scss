LOGO SUITE

"Required 2x clear space is indicated by blue lines. 1x=height and width of one arm of the cross. (...)
Clear space minimums (shown above with blue lines) are built into the logo files." (Source: brand poster)
"The button logo is our preferred logo version. The horizontal stacked orientation is our standard treatment,
and the vertical orientation is available if there are space constraints. (...)
The logo must have clear space around it. The clear space requirements are built into the logo files. No other design elements (type, other logos, etc.) should invade the clear space."

/* Digital minimum sizes 
(As long as minimum size requirements are followed, 
the button can be separated from the wordmark and scaled on its own.) */
/* TO DO: a mixin for the min. height and width is recommended.
Mixins help developers comply with style rules: just @include, and you are compliant! 
It is possible to use a switch-like syntax, either inside of variables or inside of mixins: 
"Maps allow any Sass values to be used as their keys. The==operator is used to determine whether two keys are the same."
https: //sass-lang.com/documentation/values/maps
"To help you work with nested maps,
some map functions support deep operations. For example,
if you pass multiple keys to map.get(),
it will follow those keys to find the desired nested map:"
https: //sass-lang.com/documentation/modules/map
An array is called a list in SCSS.
"The index 1 indicates the first element of the list. (...) Sass also makes it easy to refer to the end of a list. The index -1 refers to the last element in a list,
-2 refers to the second-to-last,
and so on. (...)
You can use the list.nth($list, $n) function to get the element at a given index in a list. The first argument is the list itself,
and the second is the index of the value you want to get out."
https: //sass-lang.com/documentation/values/lists
TO DO: mixin for text colours that can be used. */
/* "Because Sass is a CSS superset, we’re matching CSS’s syntax by redefining / to be only a separator. / will be treated as a new type of list separator, similar to how,
works today. Division will instead be written using the new math.div() function. This function will behave exactly the same as / does today. This deprecation does not affect uses of / inside calc() expressions."
